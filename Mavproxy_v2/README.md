# MAVPRoxy_V2

----

----

Mavproxy_v2 is run on the onboard computer (Raspberry pi) on the drone. The program is responsible to retain data from pixhawk and sends it to the internet via the GSM based internet. The mavproxy_v2 is just a variation of mavproxy in order to establish connection with the server and the ground control station(android app-Dronefly). Few changes have been made to mavproxy like receiving fly command from ground control station and sending current to server.
